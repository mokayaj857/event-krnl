# 🎟️ Avara 

## 🌍 Overview

**Avara** is a modular, decentralized event ticketing and attendance verification platform built on **KRNL**.
It eliminates ticket fraud, fake attendance, and opaque resales by transforming event tickets into **verifiable NFTs** and attendance into **on-chain POAP-style badges**.

Powered by KRNL’s decentralized orchestration layer, Avara securely connects on-chain logic with real-world systems such as **QR scanners, USSD, and mobile money**, making event access transparent, trustless, and inclusive.
